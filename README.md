# Data-Mashup-Visualization

In order to run this project, you must first start a Fuseki server using the fofproject-config.ttl. The server should be running on localhost:3030 and the data files (data-353.rdf, data-1356.rdf, data-10035.rdf) should be in the home directory of the fuseki install before starting the server.

Once the server is running you can open the html file (FOFprojectFinal.html) in the browser of your choosing and explore the project.

The page will initially load all six queries, if you select an individual query, then only the selected query will be shown.
